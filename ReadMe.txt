Input:Comparison of sorting algorithms: Merge sort vs Quick sort
vs some O(n^2) algorithm for sorting (e.g., Insertion sort, Bubble sort). 

Step:
//The elements in the array are random
1.Compile the Assignment5_a.java file
2.Run with command java Assignment5_a

Array size:1000000

Output:
***Compare Run time complexity***
Merge Sort
Total time : 787 msec.
Quick Sort
Total time : 750 msec.
Insertion Sort
Total time : 45022362 msec.

Note:Time to execute Insertion sort is too much.

// The element in the array are from specific file

1.Compile the Assignment5_aF.java file
2.Run with command java Assignment5_aF out.txt
Specify the input file path
Array size:8000000

Output:
***Compare Run time complexity***
Merge Sort
Total time : 8089 msec.
Quick Sort
Total time : 9523 msec.
Insertion Sort

Note:Time to execute Insertion sort is infinity.
